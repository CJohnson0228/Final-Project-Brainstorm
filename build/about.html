      <h6 class="about-heading"> What We are all About </h6>
			<hr>
			<p>We at Paw Paw's Bakery are a family-owned business that has enjoyed being part of the local community here in Warner Robins for the last two years. We have always had few family cats and dogs that have enriched our lives so we have always been careful about what food and treats they receive. We decided to create a treat that we could control what was being used and making sure that our pets received the best ingredients. We often shared this product with family and friends who told us that our different treats are something that all pet owners should get a chance to experience so we decided to open our business.</p>
		</div>
			
		<div class="mission p-4">	
      <h6 class="about-heading"> Coming Soon... </h6>
			<p>We offer many different types of treats for your cats or dogs no matter how big or small, or young or old. We will be bringing our treats to an online store soon that will allow you to receive your favorite treats no matter where you are located. If you look at our shop page you will be able to see our current treats we offer and the prices for those items. We also hope you will sign up for our newsletter so we can keep you updated on important news including when our digital site will go live or just to let you know about any upcoming sales.</p>
